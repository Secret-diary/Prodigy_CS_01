# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This is a simple Python script that allows you to encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher.

##Overview
The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption method where each letter in a message is shifted a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D'. Decryption reverses the process


## Usage

1. Run the script by executing `python3 prodigy_cs_01.py`.
2. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt when prompted.
3. Enter the shift value to use for the cipher.
4. Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the message.
5. Optionally, choose whether you want to save the output to a file.

## Example

Enter the message: first task  
     Enter the shift value: 5
      Encrypt or Decrypt? (Type 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'): encrypt
      Do you want to save the output to a file? (yes/no): yes
      Result: knwxy yfxp
      Output saved to 'encrypt.txt' in the current working directory.
